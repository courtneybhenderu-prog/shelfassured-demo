# Step 1: Diagnostics

Please run the SQL queries below in Supabase SQL Editor and paste the results here.

The queries check:
1. Current stores table columns
2. Sample stores with their banner_id/store_chain values
3. Whether retailer_banners table exists and what it contains
4. What v_distinct_banners returns
5. Any mismatches between store_chain and banner names

Once you paste the results, we'll proceed to Step 2 (schema migrations).
