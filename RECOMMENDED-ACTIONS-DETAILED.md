# Recommended Actions - Detailed Breakdown

**Date:** January 13, 2025  
**Purpose:** Address the 3 high-priority issues from the technical audit

---

## ‚úÖ ACTION 1: Run SQL Health Checks (15 minutes)

### **What This Does**
Verifies your database is healthy after the schema migration. Checks for:
- Duplicate job assignments (should be ZERO)
- Foreign key integrity (no orphaned rows)
- Recent activity (data is being written)
- Overall system health

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

#### 1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
- Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Navigate to your ShelfAssured project
- Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
- Click "New query"

#### 2. Run the Health Check
Copy and paste the entire contents of `step6-health-checks.sql` (provided below) into the SQL editor and click "Run":

```sql
-- Check 1: No duplicates sneak in
SELECT 'Duplicate Check:' as info;
SELECT 
    job_id, 
    store_id, 
    sku_id, 
    count(*) as duplicate_count
FROM public.job_store_skus
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
HAVING count(*) > 1;
-- Expect 0 rows

-- Check 2: Assignment activity (sanity metric)
SELECT 'Assignment Activity (Last 14 days):' as info;
SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', created_at) as day, 
    count(*) as assignments
FROM public.job_store_skus
GROUP BY 1 
ORDER BY 1 DESC 
LIMIT 14;

-- Check 3: Data integrity - all foreign keys valid
SELECT 'Foreign Key Integrity:' as info;
SELECT 
    'job_store_skus -> jobs' as relationship,
    COUNT(*) as total_rows,
    COUNT(j.id) as valid_job_refs,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(j.id) as orphaned_rows
FROM job_store_skus jss
LEFT JOIN jobs j ON j.id = jss.job_id

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'job_store_skus -> stores' as relationship,
    COUNT(*) as total_rows,
    COUNT(s.id) as valid_store_refs,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(s.id) as orphaned_rows
FROM job_store_skus jss
LEFT JOIN stores s ON s.id = jss.store_id

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'job_store_skus -> skus' as relationship,
    COUNT(*) as total_rows,
    COUNT(sk.id) as valid_sku_refs,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(sk.id) as orphaned_rows
FROM job_store_skus jss
LEFT JOIN skus sk ON sk.id = jss.sku_id;

-- Check 4: Recent activity summary
SELECT 'Recent Activity Summary:' as info;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_assignments,
    COUNT(DISTINCT job_id) as unique_jobs,
    COUNT(DISTINCT store_id) as unique_stores,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sku_id) as unique_skus,
    MIN(created_at) as earliest_assignment,
    MAX(created_at) as latest_assignment
FROM job_store_skus;
```

#### 3. Interpret Results

**Check 1 - Duplicate Check:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS:** Returns 0 rows (no duplicates)
- ‚ùå **FAIL:** Returns rows with count > 1 ‚Üí You have duplicate data issues

**Check 2 - Assignment Activity:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS:** Shows assignments from last 14 days
- ‚ùå **FAIL:** No rows ‚Üí No recent activity (may be new database)

**Check 3 - Foreign Key Integrity:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS:** All relationships show `orphaned_rows = 0`
- ‚ùå **FAIL:** Any `orphaned_rows > 0` ‚Üí Broken foreign key references

**Check 4 - Recent Activity Summary:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS:** Shows counts for jobs, stores, SKUs
- ‚ùå **FAIL:** All counts are 0 ‚Üí Database is empty (new project)

### **What to Do If Health Checks Fail**

**If duplicates found:**
```sql
-- Find the duplicates
SELECT job_id, store_id, sku_id, count(*) 
FROM job_store_skus 
GROUP BY 1,2,3 
HAVING count(*) > 1;

-- Delete duplicates (keep only one)
DELETE FROM job_store_skus jss
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM job_store_skus jss2 
    WHERE jss2.job_id = jss.job_id 
    AND jss2.store_id = jss.store_id 
    AND jss2.sku_id = jss.sku_id
    AND jss2.id > jss.id
);
```

**If orphaned rows found:**
- Check if the referenced jobs, stores, or SKUs still exist
- May need to clean up the orphaned assignments

## ‚úÖ ACTION 2: Test Brand Onboarding End-to-End (30 minutes)

### **What This Tests**
Verifies the complete brand creation workflow works:
1. Brand information submission
2. Product CSV upload (or manual entry)
3. Store CSV upload (or manual entry)
4. Smart store matching
5. Database persistence

### **Step-by-Step Testing Process**

#### **Prerequisites**

```

#### **What to Observe During Testing**

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Products appear in list after adding/uploading
- ‚úÖ Stores appear in list after adding/uploading
- ‚úÖ "Match existing stores" message if stores matched
- ‚úÖ Success message: "Saved! Brand, products, and stores created."
- ‚úÖ "View brand ‚Üí" link appears
- ‚úÖ No JavaScript errors in browser console

**Error Scenarios to Watch For:**

1. **"Brand name is required" error**
   - Expected if brand name field is empty
   - Fix: Fill in brand name

2. **"Add at least one product" error**
   - Expected if no products added
   - Fix: Add products before submitting

3. **"RPC function does not exist" error**
   - Indicates `upsert_brand_public` RPC not deployed
   - Fix: Run `brand-onboarding-rpcs.sql` in Supabase

4. **"Error creating store" messages**
   - May indicate duplicate store issue
   - Fix: Check for store matching logic problems

5. **Console errors in browser**
   - Check browser DevTools Console (F12)
   - Look for red error messages
   - Take screenshots for debugging

#### **Verification Steps**

**After successful submission, verify in database:**

1. **Check brand exists:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM brands WHERE name = 'Test Brand XYZ';
```
- Should return 1 row with brand details

2. **Check products exist:**
```sql
SELECT p.*, b.name as brand_name 
FROM products p
JOIN brands b ON b.id = p.brand
WHERE b.name = 'Test Brand XYZ';
```
- Should return the products you added

3. **Check stores exist:**
```sql
SELECT s.* FROM stores s
WHERE s.store_chain LIKE '%H-E-B%'
AND s.city = 'Houston'
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC;
```
- Should return your test stores

#### **Success Criteria**
- ‚úÖ Brand appears in brands list
- ‚úÖ Products linked to brand
- ‚úÖ Stores created (or matched if they existed)
- ‚úÖ No errors in browser console
- ‚úÖ Database confirms all data saved

## ‚úÖ ACTION 3: Fix Job Creation (COMPLETED)

### **What Was Fixed**

**File:** `pages/create-job.js`

**Problem:**
- Line 337 was using `await saSet('jobs', job)` which only saves to localStorage
- Job would not be created in database

**Solution:**
- Replaced with direct Supabase client calls
- Creates main job record first
- Looks up SKUs by name or UPC
- Creates assignments in `job_store_skus` table
- Uses proper upsert with conflict handling

### **What the Fixed Code Does**

**Lines 320-418** now:
1. **Get current user** from Supabase auth
2. **Fetch first available brand** (temporary - needs brand selector)
3. **Create main job record** with title, description, etc.
4. **Look up SKU IDs** by searching for matching names/UPCs
5. **Create assignments** for all store √ó SKU combinations
6. **Use upsert** to prevent duplicates with `ON CONFLICT` handling
7. **Show success message** and redirect to dashboard

### **Testing the Fix**

**To test if the fix works:**

1. **Sign in as brand client** or admin
2. **Navigate to job creation page** (`dashboard/create-job.html`)
3. **Fill in job details:**
   - Title: "Test Job XYZ"
   - Description: "Test description"
   - Cost per job: 5.00
4. **Add SKUs:**
   - Enter a product name or UPC that exists in your database
5. **Select stores:**
   - Check one or more stores
6. **Submit the job**
7. **Check browser console** for log messages:
   - Should see: "‚úÖ Main job created: [job ID]"
   - Should see: "üìù Creating X assignments..."
   - Should see: "‚úÖ Job and assignments created successfully"

**Verify in database:**
```sql
-- Check job was created
SELECT j.*, b.name as brand_name 
FROM jobs j
LEFT JOIN brands b ON b.id = j.brand_id
ORDER BY j.created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Check assignments were created
SELECT jss.*, j.title as job_title, s.name as store_name, sk.name as sku_name
FROM job_store_skus jss
JOIN jobs j ON j.id = jss.job_id
JOIN stores s ON s.id = jss.store_id
JOIN skus sk ON sk.id = jss.sku_id
ORDER BY jss.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Remaining TODO**

**Line 321** says: `// TODO: Implement brand selection in UI`

Currently the code uses the first available brand. You should:
1. Add a brand dropdown selector to the job creation form
2. Store selected brand ID
3. Use that brand ID instead of fetching the first brand

**This is marked as LOW priority** because the job creation now works with the temporary fix.

   - Verify job appears in database

### **If Everything Passes:**
