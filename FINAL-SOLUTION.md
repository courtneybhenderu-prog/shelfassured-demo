# Final Solution - Store Selector Fix

## The Problem (ChatGPT's Diagnosis)

**Cursor's revert was incomplete:**
- Reverted filter to use `store_chain` ✅
- BUT dropdown still uses `v_distinct_banners` which returns `banner_name` values
- **Mismatch:** Dropdown value ≠ filter field → empty results

## The Root Cause

Dropdown says: "H-E-B" (from v_distinct_banners)
Filter looks for: store.store_chain === "H-E-B"
But actual data might be: store.store_chain = "HEB" or "H-E-B Grocery" or "HEB Plus"

**Result:** No matches!

## The Fix (What ChatGPT Proposed)

1. **Create new view `v_store_chains`** that sources FROM `stores.store_chain` directly
2. **Dropdown uses this view** - shows actual store_chain values from database
3. **Filter uses same values** - exact match, no normalization
4. **Values align perfectly** - dropdown value = filter value

## What Changed

### SQL
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_store_chains AS
SELECT
  store_chain AS chain_value,
  store_chain AS chain_label,
  COUNT(*) AS store_count
FROM stores
WHERE store_chain IS NOT NULL AND store_chain <> '' AND is_active = true
GROUP BY store_chain
ORDER BY store_chain;
```

### JavaScript
- Loads from `v_store_chains` (not `v_distinct_banners`)
- Dropdown value = `chain_value` (exact `store_chain` from database)
- Filter uses: `store.store_chain === selectedValue` (exact match)
- Shows store count: "H-E-B (429)"

## How to Deploy

1. Run `FIX-STORES-FILTER-ALIGNMENT.sql` in Supabase (creates the view)
2. Wait for GitHub Pages to deploy the JS changes (1-2 minutes)
3. Hard refresh the page
4. Test

## Expected Results

✅ Dropdown shows chains with exact counts from stores table
✅ Selecting "H-E-B" returns 429 stores
✅ Selecting "Albertsons" returns 480 stores
✅ Search "Bridgeland" works
✅ Search "Austin" works
✅ All chains appear (not just 9)

## Why This Works

- No `banner_id` complexity
- Dropdown value = filter value (exact match)
- Uses existing `store_chain` field
- Simple and reliable
