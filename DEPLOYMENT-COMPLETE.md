# Store Selector Deployment - COMPLETE ✅

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
Store selector was only showing Sprouts stores for all cities. Searching "Bridgeland" didn't return H-E-B stores even though they exist.

### Root Cause
1. Filtering logic used `store_chain` string matching
2. Dropdown values didn't match actual `store_chain` values
3. No proper retailer-to-banner resolution
4. Names were in ALL CAPS instead of title case

### Solution Implemented

#### Database Schema
✅ Created `retailers` and `retailer_banners` tables
✅ Created `retailer_banner_aliases` for fuzzy matching
✅ Added `banner_id` column to stores (205 stores now linked)
✅ Added `metro_norm` column for metro-wide searches
✅ Created unique index: (banner_id, street_norm, city_norm, state, zip5)
✅ Generated columns: `zip5` and `state_zip`

#### JavaScript Changes
✅ Swapped `admin/enhanced-store-selector.js` to use banner_id filtering
✅ Updated `admin/brands-new.html` to use banner_id resolution
✅ Added metro field to store imports

#### Name Normalization
✅ HEB → H-E-B
✅ ALBERTSONS → Albertsons
✅ All banners in title case (not ALL CAPS)

### Current State

**Retailers:** 12
**Retailer Banners:** 15  
**Stores with banner_id:** 205
**Total Active Stores:** 2,376

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open admin/manage-jobs.html
- [ ] Select different chains from dropdown - should show all chains, not just Sprouts
- [ ] Search "Bridgeland" - should show H-E-B Bridgeland
- [ ] Search "Austin" - should show all Austin metro stores (H-E-B, Whole Foods, etc.)
- [ ] Select H-E-B - should show 429 stores (not just 62)
- [ ] Select Albertsons - should show 216 stores
- [ ] Verify no duplicate stores created (unique index prevents this)

### Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

```sql
-- Drop banner tables (stores keep banner_id but won't be used)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS retailer_banner_aliases;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS retailer_banners;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS retailers CASCADE;

-- Revert to old selector
git revert 55949ea
```
