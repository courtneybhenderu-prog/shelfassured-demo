# ðŸ”’ ShelfAssured Security Review Checklist

A practical, phased security audit system designed for small teams with limited budgets.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This checklist provides a structured approach to security that balances risk, cost, and development velocity. It's designed to be completed in phases, with each phase building on the previous one.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: Immediate Security Fixes (30 minutes)

### âœ… API Key Security
- [ ] **Rotate exposed API key** - Create new key in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] **Revoke old key** - Delete the compromised key immediately
- [ ] **Restrict new key** - Limit to specific APIs and referrers (*.github.io)
- [ ] **Verify .env.example** - Ensure it exists and documents all required keys
- [ ] **Add pre-commit hook** - Consider git-secrets or GitGuardian CLI

### âœ… Database Security (RLS)
- [ ] **Verify RLS enabled** - Check all user-specific tables have RLS active
- [ ] **Test policy enforcement** - Run `SELECT auth.uid()` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] **Document policy matrix** - Map which roles can access which tables
- [ ] **Test user isolation** - Confirm users can't access other users' data

### âœ… Authentication Security
- [ ] **Email verification enforced** - `auth.enable_email_signups = true`
- [ ] **Email confirmation required** - `auth.email_confirm_required = true`
- [ ] **Session expiration** - Verify Supabase default (1 week) is appropriate
- [ ] **Cookie security** - Add `sameSite: "strict"` and `secure: true` if managing tokens

---

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: Short-term Security Improvements (1-2 hours)

### âœ… Input Validation
- [ ] **Client-side validation** - HTML5 validation + regex for email/name fields
- [ ] **Server-side validation** - Use validation libraries (zod, validator.js)
- [ ] **SQL injection prevention** - Ensure no raw SQL concatenation
- [ ] **XSS prevention** - Sanitize user input before display

### âœ… Error Handling
- [ ] **Sanitize error messages** - No sensitive data in user-facing errors
- [ ] **Implement error logging** - Capture via `console.error()` in dev
- [ ] **User-friendly errors** - Generic messages like "Something went wrong"
- [ ] **Error monitoring** - Set up basic error tracking

### âœ… Session Management
- [ ] **Session invalidation** - Implement logout-all functionality
- [ ] **Password change security** - Invalidate all sessions on password change
- [ ] **Token handling** - Secure storage and transmission of tokens
- [ ] **Session timeout** - Implement appropriate timeout for admin sessions

---

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Medium-term Security Hardening (2-4 hours)

### âœ… Security Headers
- [ ] **Content Security Policy** - `default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: https://*.googleapis.com;`
- [ ] **X-Frame-Options** - `DENY` to prevent clickjacking
- [ ] **X-Content-Type-Options** - `nosniff` to prevent MIME sniffing
- [ ] **Referrer-Policy** - `no-referrer` to limit referrer information
- [ ] **Strict-Transport-Security** - `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

### âœ… Monitoring & Auditing
- [ ] **Supabase logs** - Enable and review Auth, SQL, Function logs
- [ ] **Failed login tracking** - Implement brute force detection
- [ ] **GitHub Secret Scanning** - Ensure it's enabled for the repository
- [ ] **Dependabot alerts** - Enable for dependency vulnerability scanning

### âœ… Advanced Security
- [ ] **Rate limiting** - Implement API endpoint protection
- [ ] **CORS configuration** - Properly configure cross-origin requests
- [ ] **Security logging** - Implement comprehensive audit trail
- [ ] **Incident response** - Document procedures for security issues

---

## ðŸš¨ Critical Security Tests

### âœ… Authentication Flow Tests
- [ ] **Email confirmation** - Test unconfirmed users can't access protected pages
- [ ] **Role-based access** - Verify admin/shelfer/brand_client isolation
- [ ] **Session persistence** - Test sessions survive page refreshes
- [ ] **Logout functionality** - Confirm complete session termination

### âœ… Data Access Tests
- [ ] **User data isolation** - Users can't access other users' data
- [ ] **Admin privileges** - Admin can access all data, others cannot
- [ ] **Public data access** - Unauthenticated users can only access public pages
- [ ] **API endpoint security** - Protected endpoints require authentication

---

## ðŸ“Š Security Metrics & Monitoring

### âœ… Key Metrics to Track
- [ ] **Failed login attempts** - Monitor for brute force attacks
- [ ] **API key usage** - Track unusual API call patterns
- [ ] **Database query patterns** - Monitor for suspicious SQL activity
- [ ] **Error rates** - Track and investigate error spikes

### âœ… Alert Thresholds
- [ ] **Failed logins** - Alert after 5 failed attempts in 10 minutes
- [ ] **API errors** - Alert after 10 errors in 5 minutes
- [ ] **Database errors** - Alert after 5 SQL errors in 1 minute
- [ ] **Security events** - Immediate alert for any security-related errors

---

## ðŸ”„ Monthly Security Review Process

### âœ… Monthly Checklist (30 minutes)
- [ ] **Review security logs** - Check for unusual activity
- [ ] **Update dependencies** - Apply security patches
- [ ] **Test authentication** - Verify login/logout flows
- [ ] **Review user access** - Confirm role-based access is working
- [ ] **Check API keys** - Verify no new keys have been exposed
- [ ] **Update documentation** - Keep security docs current

### âœ… Quarterly Deep Review (2 hours)
- [ ] **Full security audit** - Comprehensive system review
- [ ] **Penetration testing** - Basic security testing
- [ ] **Policy review** - Update security policies and procedures
- [ ] **Team training** - Security awareness and best practices
- [ ] **Incident response** - Test and update incident response procedures
