# UX Plan (Concise)

## Shopper flow
1. Splash → Sign In → Dashboard (#4)
2. Tap a job → Job Details (#5)
3. Start Job → Photo Capture (#6)
4. Use Photo → Analysis (#7)
5. Submit → My Jobs (#9)

## Client flow
1. Splash → Client Login → Client Dashboard (#8)
2. Create New Job (#13) → Create Job Form (#20) → Publish (appears in Shopper jobs)
3. Open Client Snapshot (#19) → Print/Save PDF

## Admin flow
1. Splash → Admin Login → Admin Dashboard (#14)
2. Users (#15) • Jobs (#16) • Support (#17)

### Navigation safety
- Quick Nav dropdown available anywhere (≡ Menu).
- Back buttons where linear flows happen (#5, #6, #12, #15–17, #19).
